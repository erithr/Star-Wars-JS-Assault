# Star-Wars-JS-Assault
This Project is a fun little game showing object manipulation and stat tracking


## How to Play:

The game starts ready to play, begin by selecting your character and this will move the remaining characters into an attack state. Once you have selected your character you may select an opponent. This will move them into the deffender area and make them available to be attacked. 

## How attacking works:

Once the enemy is in the deffender row the attack button will do two thing, first it will cause the enemy to attack the player and also allow the player to attack the enemy as well as increasing in attack power. Both actions happen simultaniously so a player may die at the same time as their enemy. 


## Current State of Game:

Curently the game is missing a function to check the health totals of characters so if a player or enemy goes below 0 health nothing happens as of yet. Missing a way to end the game cause of this since the combat currently goes on indefinitely.
